#A surprising gift
"Oh,sorry,but there's someone knocking my door,I'll call you back soon. " I walk to the door and open it. "Who are …"my mouth suddenly stop.There isn't anything outside the door but a small blue box. I feel strange. Is that a bomb? I don't know. I become nervous. So I walk into my room and take out a long scissors and a pair of glasses that is used to protect my eyes.  I use the scissors carefully to cut the cover of the box,looking if there is something dangerous. 

Good news,there is just something that can't hurt me. Now the box isn't covered,and there is some word written on it clearly. "Human OS 1.0…"

I close the door and walk straight to my desk. I open the box carefully,looking what is in it. I found a disk in it,with a small piece of paper. I start to read the paper.

>Thank you for using Human OS v1.0, with it you can control you body from the most basic things , including breathing , eating and even rejection reaction.

I'm a little suprised. Human now can already use brain waves to connect themselve with computers in order to edit their memory, but it also impossible to install a operating system in a person's  brain. I feel very excited because of the words on the instruction paper. I continue reading

>It's very easy to install the system into your brain.

>1.make a communication between you brain to your computer

>2.open the command line tool in your computer( *Command prompt* for Windows and *Terminal* for Mac OS or Linux)

>3.connect the disk with the computer

>4.type in 
```
users name/*enter*/
password/*enter*/
```

>5.if you are using Windows,type in
```
start D:\humanos\setup.exe\
```
>Mac users type in
```
start D:\humanos\setup.dmg\
```

>6.wait for minutes, may feel sick during the install, but it is normal, just wait

>7.when the program shows "complete",you have install the system into your brain

Well, I am so excited that I can't wait to do that.  I quickly lunch my computer, connect my brain and the disk, typing in my username and password. I have finished all the works but lunch the program. Suddenly, I fall into deep thinking. What if I touch the enter botton? Human haven't do this before, I am the first one. I maybe killed, because I really don't konw who put this disk in fornt of my house.What if...Well,what if it's true, and I will be the first people who can really control their body.
I take a deep breath with my eyes closed, touching the enter botton.

This is UTC 1970, Janurary 1st 0:00 am.Welcome to login Human OS v1.0.

A line of word suddenly displayed in front of my eyes.
> Failed to start

I get up and feel a little tired. Why I am here? I look around. The sky should be dark at night, but it's light. Oh, it isn't sky! There are many screens around me, and they are displaying the image of sky. Where is there?
